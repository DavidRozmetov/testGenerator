Activity 4
Correct order: 3, 1, 7, 4, 9, 6, 10, 5, 8, 2 
My dear Fred,
I don’t think I have long left to live now, so this will probably be my last letter to you. Before I die, there’s one thing I want to ask you – try to be a good friend to your uncle Ebenezer. I know he seems to hate people, but remember that he had a difficult life when he was younger. You see, our father was a cold, hard man, who didn’t love Ebenezer at all. And so, as a child, Ebenezer too became cold, and spent a lot of time alone. When he was older and started work, he began to show an unhealthy interest in money, and that was the reason why he never married. There was a girl who loved him once, a beautiful young woman called Belle. But when she realized that he would always love money more than her, she married another man. Poor Ebenezer! I know that you, with your warm heart, will feel sorry for him, now that I’ve told you this. Take care of yourself, my dear boy, and think of me sometimes, when I am gone.
Your loving mother
Activity 5
Possible answers would be:
1 You should always try to be kind and generous and cheerful, and think of other people.
2 Nobody likes a cross, mean, miserable person.
3 The most important thing in life is to live a good and happy life.
4 It is never too late to change (your way of life).
Activity 6
This is just one possibility:
Ebenezer Scrooge did not do everything that he had promised. He did pay Bob Cratchit thirty shillings a year, but poor Bob had to work very hard for it. It was too late for Scrooge to change his ways, and soon he became as mean and miserable as he had been before. There was no extra wood for the fire in Bob’s office, and Scrooge never became a good friend to the Cratchits or a second father to Tiny Tim. Sadly, Tiny Tim died later that year. The Cratchit family were very unhappy, but they tried to be cheerful and were always kind to each other.
Scrooge’s heart grew colder and colder, until one day he was found dead in his bed by one of the cleaning- women. Now he lies in the graveyard, in the cold, hard ground, and nobody cried at his death or put flowers on his grave.
