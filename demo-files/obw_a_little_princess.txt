after reading
1
Dear Ermie,
I have something wonderful to tell you! I am writing this in the Indian gentleman’s house. His name is Mr Carrisford, and he was my father’s friend in India. And, Ermie, there WERE diamonds in the mines – thousands of them – but they only found them after my father died.
Mr Carrisford was ill with a fever too, and when he got better, he came to England to look for me. But he couldn’t find me because he didn’t know my name. And all the time, Ermie, I was a servant in the house next door!
Half of the diamonds are mine now, Mr Carrisford says. But the nicest thing is this, Ermie. Mr Carrisford is a very kind man, and he wants to take care of me. So I’m going to live with him and have a home again. You must come and visit me often.
Your best friend, Sara

The picture goes on page 23.
1	Ram Dass, the lascar servant from next door.
2	The monkey is running round Sara’s room.
3	Ram Dass comes across the roof into Sara’s room. The monkey jumps into his arms, and Ram Dass goes back across the roof into the house next door.

Possible captions from the text:
At the next window Sara saw a face – the smiling face of an Indian lascar.
‘Oh,’ cried Sara, ‘have you got a monkey? He’s in my room.’
Ram Dass gave Sara a big smile.

Or students might like to be more imaginative, for example:
At last there was someone for Sara to talk to.

3
5 Lavinia:	Oh, Miss Minchin. I have something to tell you!
2 Miss Minchin:	Yes, Lavinia, what is it?
12 Lavinia:	Ermengarde isn’t in her bed, Miss Minchin.
10 Miss Minchin: But it’s after ten o’clock! Where  	is she?
1 Lavinia:	Upstairs, in the attic.
11 Miss Minchin: What’s she doing up there?
7 Lavinia:	She’s having tea with Princess Sara.
4 Miss Minchin:	Having tea with—! How do you know this, Lavinia?
9 Lavinia:	I saw her on the stairs, with a big box.
6 Miss Minchin:	A box? What was in it?
3 Lavinia:	A big cake. She said Sara was hungry.
8 Miss Minchin:	Of course she isn’t hungry! Right. I’m going upstairs at once. You were right to tell me this, Lavinia. You can go back to bed now.

4
Miss Minchin says 9 untrue things, but to correct them students will need to make 12 alterations to the words.
‘Sara Crewe? Oh yes, she lives next door now, with Mr Carrisford, her father’s friend. I was not kind (I was very unkind) to her when her father died in India. She slept in the attic (a servant’s room) and was often (always) cold and hungry. She taught French to the younger children, and she worked in the kitchen and the house. I saw Mr Carrisford yesterday. He was very angry, and he doesn’t want Sara to come back to my school.’
5
The answer to the riddle is:
DIAMONDS (SAD, ILL, TEA, MAGIC, COOK, KIND, DOLL, PRINCESS).
Students should try out different letters from the clue words until they get the right combination (or guess the answer from the description).
