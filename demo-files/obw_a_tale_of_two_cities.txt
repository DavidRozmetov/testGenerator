Darnay appeared before the Tribunal a second time, because he was accused by three citizens. When Dr Manette heard that he was one of the accusers, he spoke angrily to the Tribunal. But Defarge explained that he had found a paper written by Dr Manette in the Bastille, and he read it aloud to the Tribunal. The paper told a story of the Evrémonde brothers, who had caused the deaths of four members of a family. The people were so angry to hear of these crimes that they said Darnay must go to the Guillotine the next day.
After the trial, Sydney Carton went to the Defarges’ wine-shop, where he heard Madame Defarge talking about her family. Madame Defarge did not want to stop the killing until all the Evrémonde family were dead. Dr Manette could do nothing to help Darnay because his mind had returned to the past. Carton, however, had a plan, which he kept to himself.
